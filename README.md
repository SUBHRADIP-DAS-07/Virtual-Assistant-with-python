# Virtual-Assistant-with-python
This is an attempt of making a desktop virtual assistant with python language which would do basic tasks like paly music, reply to queries, play videos directly on youtube etc.
The basic structure of the project, is inspired by some other github projects, but along with it I added some other features like extra greetings, translate any sentence, google search result reply etc.
